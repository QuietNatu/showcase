# Themes

Several themes that change the visual style of the application are provided and can be used to customize its color scheme or support multi-brand applications.

To use a theme, simply import its stylesheet and apply the corresponding `data-theme` HTML attribute to an element in the document.
This makes it possible to use several themes at once in the same app, which can be useful, for example, to apply the inverse color scheme to some components.
