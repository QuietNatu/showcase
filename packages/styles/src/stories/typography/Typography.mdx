# Typography

## Fonts

There are two types of fonts used throughout the application:

- **Headings:** Use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) to add some styling to the page.
- **Body Text:** Uses the [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/) for familiarity and cross-platform performance.

## Headings

Two types of headings are provided for different scenarios:

### 1. Regular Headings

These are fixed in size and do not change based on the viewport. They allow for a higher density of information.

These are the default heading type, prioritizing space efficiency. Use them in most scenarios.

<Canvas of={stories.Headings} />

### 2. Fluid Headings

These adapt based on the size of the viewport, making them more prominent on larger viewports.

Use them to grab the user's attention, for example, on product pages, landing pages, or when onboarding users.

<Canvas of={stories.Fluid} />

## Body Text

<Canvas of={stories.Body} />

## Weights

<Canvas of={stories.Weights} />
